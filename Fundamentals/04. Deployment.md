### Casual cluster Architecture

#### Core Servers (Read-write): Synced cluster 
- Recommended replication factor is 3

Core Servers' main responsibility is to safeguard data. The Core Servers do so by replicating all transactions using the Raft protocol. Raft ensures that the data is safely durable before confirming transaction commit to the end user application. In practice this means once a majority of Core Servers in a cluster (N/2+1) have accepted the transaction, it is safe to acknowledge the commit to the end user application.


#### Replica Servers (Read Replica): Query, view
- Spin up based on the demand
- Near accurate. 

Read Replicas' main responsibility is to scale out graph workloads (Cypher queries, procedures, and so on). Read Replicas act like caches for the data that the Core Servers safeguard, but they are not simple key-value caches. In fact Read Replicas are fully-fledged Neo4j databases capable of fulfilling arbitrary (read-only) graph queries and procedures.
