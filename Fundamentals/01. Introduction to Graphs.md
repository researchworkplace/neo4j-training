# Introduction to Graphs
A graph is composed of two elements: a node and a relationship. 
Each node represents an entity (a person, place, thing, category or other piece of data), and each relationship represents how two nodes are associated. This general-purpose structure allows you to model all kinds of scenarios – from a system of roads, to a network of devices, to a population’s medical history or anything else defined by relationships.
Graphs are extremely flexible.
